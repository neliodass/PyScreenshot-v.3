## File naming 
If you won't specify the screenshot name will be saved with name:
`MM_DD_YYYhhmmss.jpg` in chosed folder and `shortened__path___MM_DD_YYYhhmmss.jpg` in default folder.

If you won't specify the directory to save, screenshot will be saved only in default folder with name `name___MM_DD_YYYhhmmss.jpg`

Normally screenshot will be saved in default folder with name:
`shortened__path___name___MM_DD_YYYhhmmss.jpg`
and in selected folder with name:
`name___MM_DD_YYYhhmmss.jpg`
## File Structure

- `main.py`: The main script containing the application logic.
- `.config`: A JSON configuration file storing the default folder path and recent directories.

## Configuration File

The `.config` file is a JSON file that stores the default folder path and recent directories.
